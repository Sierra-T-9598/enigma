# ENIGMA 🧩

Welcome to my command line interface, encryption and decryption tool.

Use the two runner files, `encrypt.rb` and `decrypt.rb` to execute
encryption and decryption of a message contained in `message.txt`.

Ruby (v. 2.7.2)

## HOW TO ‍👨‍💻

[Install Ruby!](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)

1. Run the "encrypt" runner file in your terminal with the command:
`ruby ./lib/encrypt.rb message.txt encrypted.txt`

  This will take the message already in the message file and create its
  encryption in the 'encrypted.txt'.

2. Run the "decrypt" runner file in your terminal with the command:
`ruby ./lib/decrypt.rb encrypted.txt decrypted.txt <key used for encryption>
<date used for encryption>`

  This will take the encrypted message and decrypt it to the 'decrypted.txt'.
  🟡 Note: You will be required to provide four command line arguments for
  decryption: 2 text files & the key and date printed to your terminal after
  running the encryption.

## SELF ASSESSMENT ✔️
Based on the Enigma - Evaluation Rubric, I have completed all the requirements
to 'Meets expectations', and met 'Above Expectations' for Object Oriented Programming.

  ### Functionality
  + ✔️ #encrypt and #decrypt are successfully implemented in the Enigma class.
  + ✔️ Running encryption and decryption from the CLI is successfully implemented.

  ### Object Oriented Programming
  + ✔️ I broke the project down into logical components, starting small to make the ultimate Enigma class functionality:
    + KeyMaker
    + OffsetMaker
    + ShiftFinder
    + Enigma
  + ✔️ All classes are reasonably sized and have a pre-determined responsibilities surrounding a given functionality.
    + KeyMaker takes in a key and/or generates one before generating a hash with
    4 keys corresponding to A,B,C,D.
    + OffsetMaker takes in a date and/or generates today's date before calculating
    offsets that correspond to an A,B,C, or D key.
    + ShiftFinder takes in the KeyMaker hash and OffsetMaker hash and adds their
    values together to create a new hash with the final shift amounts for each.
    + Enigma is akin to a puzzle maker, and since it made the puzzle, it also holds the key to solving it. It needs a KeyMaker, an OffsetMaker, and a ShiftFinder,
    in order to first encrypt a message with the given shifts and then decrypt the message
    using the same shifts, the key, and the date used for encryption.
  + ✔️ Shiftable module is included in the Enigma class to handle the shifting of the message and ciphertext. It contains two methods, one for the forward shift and one for the backward shift. This functionality is abstracted away from the Enigma class because the behaviors of #encrypt and #decrypt for Enigma are nearly identical and can be called on from an outside module in order to make the complexity of the Enigma more hidden, and portray only the necessary output of encryption/decryption, the encrypted or decrypted hash.

  ### Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
  + ✔️ Code is properly indented, spaced, and lines are not over 76.
  + ✔️ All class, method, variable, and file names follow convention
  + ✔️ Most of the enumerables and data structures chosen are the most efficient
  + ✔️ Implemented multiple hashes in a logical manner
    + KeyMaker, OffsetMaker, and ShiftFinder classes all result in hashes that
    work together to keep track of and generate the A,B,C,D shifts.

  ### Test Driven Development
  + ✔️ Every class has a spec file and every method within a class is completely
  tested to verify the expected behavior.
  + ✔️ At the integration level, the KeyMaker, OffsetMaker, and ShiftFinder are all
  put to the test in the functioning of the Enigma class, and subsequently the
  functioning of the command line interface.
  + ✔️ Edge cases like, characters outside of the alphabet array, uppercased messages,
  and shift amounts of any possible amount (i.e. max of 99 + 9 = 108) are addressed.
  + ✔️ git history shows that I wrote all tests first, prior to working with
  implementation code.
  + ✔️ Simple cov shoes coverage at 100%

  #### Version Control
  + Total commits: 73
  + Uses logical pull request workflow.

  #### Score I would give myself: Passing
